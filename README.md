# Deployment with Streamlit & FastAPI
## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model using Streamlit and FastAPI. The application allows users to interact with the model, visualize results, and even train the model based on their own data.

### Features
1. FastAPI Integration: The backend is built using FastAPI for efficient and scalable API handling.
2. Streamlit Frontend: A user-friendly interface with three key pages:
3. Base Model: Displays the base machine learning model.
4. Visualization: Provides visual representations of the model's results.
5. User Train Model: Allows users to train a basic model using their own data.
